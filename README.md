# Architectural-view-in-three.js

Developers: Benjamin, Oluwasesan & Xander
Initial project breakdown for 2023-03-21

	1) Design and modeling of the house:
Decide on the overall design and layout of the house, including the location of different rooms, furniture, and decorations.
Model the house using a 3D modeling software, such as Blender or SketchUp, and export it to a format that can be imported into Three.js (e.g. OBJ, GLTF).
Assign appropriate textures to different parts of the house (walls, floors, ceilings, etc.), and export them as separate image files. At least two textures should be generated using POV-Ray.

Tasks:

One team member can focus on the overall design and layout of the house, while another member can work on modeling the house in a 3D software.
The third member can work on generating textures using POV-Ray.


	2) Implementation of Three.js scene:
Create a new Three.js project, and import the 3D model of the house.
Use different primitives (e.g. BoxGeometry, SphereGeometry) to add furniture and decorations to the scene.
Add at least three different light sources to the scene (e.g. directional light for external lighting, point light for indoor lighting).
Create a skydome or skybox to add a realistic sky background to the scene.
Add shaders to enhance the visual quality of the scene (e.g. Phong or Lambert shading for materials).

Tasks:

One team member can focus on setting up the basic Three.js scene, importing the 3D model and adding primitives.
Another team member can work on adding different light sources to the scene and creating a skydome/skybox.
The third member can work on implementing shaders to enhance the visual quality of the scene.



	3) Integration of POV-Ray textures:
Import the generated POV-Ray textures into the Three.js project, and assign them to the appropriate parts of the house.
Write code to ensure that the POV-Ray textures are displayed correctly in the scene.

Tasks:

One team member can focus on importing and integrating the POV-Ray textures into the Three.js project.
The other two members can assist with testing and ensuring that the textures are displayed correctly in the scene.



	4) Implementation of interactive walkthrough:
Write code to enable the user to move around the house using the keyboard or mouse.
Add animations or other interactive elements to the scene (e.g. a small waterfall).

Tasks:

One team member can focus on implementing the code for the interactive walkthrough.
The other two members can work on adding animations or other interactive elements to the scene.



	5) Documentation:
Write comments and documentation to explain the different functions and components of the code.
Create a README file explaining how to run the code and any other relevant information.
